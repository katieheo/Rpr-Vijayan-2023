## Study Metadata

- `Key words`: Comma-separated list of keywords (tags) for searchability. Geographers often use one or two keywords each for: theory, geographic context, and methods.
- `Subject`: select from the [BePress Taxonomy](http://digitalcommons.bepress.com/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1008&context=reference)
- `Date created`: date when project was started
- `Date modified`: date of most recent revision
- `Spatial Coverage`: Specify the geographic extent of your study. This may be a place name and link to a feature in a gazetteer like GeoNames or OpenStreetMap, or a well known text (WKT) representation of a bounding box.
- `Spatial Resolution`: Specify the spatial resolution as a scale factor, description of the level of detail of each unit of observation (including administrative level of administrative areas), and/or or distance of a raster GRID size
- `Spatial Reference System`: Specify the geographic or projected coordinate system for the study
- `Temporal Coverage`: Specify the temporal extent of your study---i.e. the range of time represented by the data observations.
- `Temporal Resolution`: Specify the temporal resolution of your study---i.e. the duration of time for which each observation represents or the revisit period for repeated observations
- `Funding Name`: name of funding for the project
- `Funding Title`: title of project grant
- `Award info URI`: web address for award information
- `Award number`: award number

## Compendium structure and contents

This research compendium is structured with four main directories:

- `data`: contains subdirectories for `raw` data and `derived` data.
- `docs`: contains subdirectories for `manuscript`, `presentation`, and `report`
- `procedure`: contains subdirectories for `code` or software scripts, information about the computational `environment` in which the research was conducted, and non-code research `protocols`
- `results`: contains subdirectories for `figures`, formatted data `tables`, or `other` formats of research results.

The data, procedures, and results of this repository are outlined in three tables:
- Data: [data/data_index.csv](data/data_index.csv)
- Procedures: [procedure/procedure_index.csv](procedure/procedure_index.csv)
- Results: [results/results_index.csv](results/results_index.csv)

Important local **documents** include:
- Pre-analysis plan: [docs/report/preanalysis.pdf](docs/report/preanalysis.pdf)
- Study report: [docs/report/report.pdf](docs/report/report.pdf)
- Manuscript: [docs/manuscript/manuscript.pdf](docs/manuscript/manuscript.pdf)
- Presentation: [docs/presentation/presentation.pdf](docs/presentation/presentation.pdf)
