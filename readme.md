# Reproduction of Vijayan et al 2020 Beyond the 405 and the 5: Geographic Variations and Factors Associated With Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Positivity Rates in Los Angeles County

## Abstract

This study replicates and extends the spatial analysis conducted by Vijayan et al. (2020) on SARS-CoV-2 outcomes in Los Angeles County (LAC). The original study examined spatial patterns in age-adjusted testing rates, age-adjusted diagnosis rates, and crude positivity rates, utilizing a hexagonal grid. However, issues with the grid's connectivity prompted the creation of a new grid for this reproduction. The study also addressed data imputation challenges in variables 'age18' and 'age65'. Using R and spatial analysis packages, we performed LISA analyses, reproducing clusters for testing rates, diagnosis rates, and positivity rates. The spatial lag models were replicated to assess predictors' effects on crude positivity rates, age-adjusted diagnosis rates, and age-adjusted testing rates. Our results provides insights into spatial patterns and predictors of SARS-CoV-2 outcomes in Los Angeles County.

This study is a *reproduction* study of:

## Abstract

Vijayan et al. (2020) examined whether spatial patterns existed in SARS-CoV-2 age-adjusted testing rates, age-adjusted diagnosis rates, and crude positivity rates in Los Angeles County (LAC), and used a spatial regression model to explore associations between COVID-19 crude positivity rates and a series of predictor variables. The original analyses are retrospective and use observational data collected from federal and private sources. Although not publicly available, we were able to obtain the original study data after contacting the authors. However, the analysis code was not made available, nor was information about the computational environment used.
