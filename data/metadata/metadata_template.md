- `Title`: COVID-19 Data from Los Angeles, California in 2020
- `Abstract`: Predictor variables were obtained from the 2018 5-year American Community Survey at the census tract level. Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) or COVID-19 testing and diagnosis data were obtained from the LAC Department of Public Health COVID-19 surveillance dashboard (http://dashboard.publichealth. lacounty.gov/covid19_surveillance_dashboard/) through 30 June 2022.
- `Spatial Coverage`: Los Angeles County (LAC), California
>Specify the geographic extent of your study. This may be a place name and link to a feature in a gazetteer like GeoNames or OpenStreetMap, or a well known text (WKT) representation of a bounding box.
- `Spatial Resolution`: Census data was obtained at the tract level.
>Specify the spatial resolution as a scale factor, description of the level of detail of each unit of observation (including administrative level of administrative areas), and/or or distance of a raster GRID size
- `Spatial Reference System`: Specify the geographic or projected coordinate system for the study
- `Temporal Coverage`: Specify the temporal extent of your study---i.e. the range of time represented by the data observations.
- `Temporal Resolution`: Specify the temporal resolution of your study---i.e. the duration of time for which each observation represents or the revisit period for repeated observations
- `Lineage`: 
  - With the 2018 5-year American Community Survey (U.S. Census) and LAC Department of Public Health COVID-19 surveillance dashboard data, Vijayan et al. created a grid of hexagons. The authors did not provide any details about the algorithm or parameters used to create the grid. Each hexagon in the grid encompassed an area of 10 square kilometers. Once created, the grid was overlaid onto the centroids of city, community, and census tract boundaries within LAC, and all data were summarized and joined to the hexagon layer by location. Hexagons that either contained missing COVID-19 data, had a population of less than 1,000 people, or did not have contiguous neighbors were excluded from the analysis. The initial analysis sample contained 184 hexagons. However, we recreated the hexagon layer to contain the contiguous neighbors so that it did not have any gaps. Our final analysis sample contained 188 hexagons. 
>Describe and/or cite data sources and/or methodological steps taken or planned to create this data source, e.g.:
  - sampling scheme, including spatial sampling
  - Where did these hexagons come from? Provided by the authors - what were the data sources the authors used? The story of the data until you got it.
  - target sample size and method for determining sample size
  - stopping criteria for data collection and sampling (e.g. sample size, time elapsed)
  - de-identification / anonymization
  - experimental manipulation
- `Distribution`: Describe who will make the data available and how?
- `Constraints`: Legal constraints for *access* or *use* to protect *privacy* or *intellectual property rights*
- `Data Quality`: State any planned quality assessment
- `Variables`: For each variable, enter the following information. If you have two or more variables per data source, you may want to present this information in table form (shown below)
  - `Label`: variable name as used in the data or code
  - `Alias`: intuitive natural language name
  - `Definition`: Short description or definition of the variable. Include measurement units in description.
  - `Type`: data type, e.g. character string, integer, real
  - `Accuracy`: e.g. uncertainty of measurements
  - `Domain`: Expected range of Maximum and Minimum of numerical data, or codes or categories of nominal data, or reference to a standard codebook
  - `Missing Data Value(s)`: Values used to represent missing data and frequency of missing data observations
  - `Missing Data Frequency`: Frequency of missing data observations: not yet known for data to be collected
