## Materials and procedure

### Computational environment

We are working on R (version 4.3.1). 
The packages we used are 'sf', 'tidyverse', 'ggplot2', 'here', 'spdep', 'spatialreg', 'car', 'ggmap', and 'dplyr'. 

### Data and variables

All data used in the study is secondary. The data sources are the 2018 5-year American Community Survey (U.S. Census) and LAC Department of Public Health COVID-19 surveillance dashboard. 
Predictor variables were obtained from the 2018 5-year American Community Survey at the census tract level. Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) or COVID-19 testing and diagnosis data were obtained from the LAC Department of Public Health COVID-19 surveillance dashboard (http://dashboard.publichealth. lacounty.gov/covid19_surveillance_dashboard/) through 30 June 2022.

**Standard Metadata**
- `Title`: COVID-19 Data from Los Angeles, California in 2020
- `Abstract`: Predictor variables were obtained from the 2018 5-year American Community Survey at the census tract level. Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) or COVID-19 testing and diagnosis data were obtained from the LAC Department of Public Health COVID-19 surveillance dashboard (http://dashboard.publichealth. lacounty.gov/covid19_surveillance_dashboard/) through 30 June 2022.
- `Spatial Coverage`: Los Angeles County (LAC), California
- `Spatial Resolution`: The total area of the hexagons are 4380 squared kilometers, each being 10 square kilometers. 
- `Spatial Reference System`: ESPG:32611
- `Temporal Coverage`: The census data was from 2018 and the LAC public health data was from the start of the pandemic to 30 June 2022. 
- `Lineage`:
  - Census data was obtained at the tract level.
  - With the 2018 5-year American Community Survey (U.S. Census) and LAC Department of Public Health COVID-19 surveillance dashboard data, Vijayan et al. created a grid of hexagons. The authors did not provide any details about the algorithm or parameters used to create the grid.
  - Each hexagon in the grid encompassed an area of 10 square kilometers. Once created, the grid was overlaid onto the centroids of city, community, and census tract boundaries within LAC, and all data were summarized and joined to the hexagon layer by location. Hexagons that either contained missing COVID-19 data, had a population of less than 1,000 people, or did not have contiguous neighbors were excluded from the analysis.
  - The initial analysis sample contained 184 hexagons. However, we recreated the hexagon layer to contain the contiguous neighbors so that it did not have any gaps. Our final analysis sample contained 188 hexagons.
- `Distribution`: U.S. Census and the LAC Department of Public Health
- `Constraints`: No legal constraints for *access* or *use* to protect *privacy* or *intellectual property rights*
- `Data Quality`: We don't have access to the raw data from U.S. census, we got the already aggregated data to work with from the reproduction study.

### Prior observations  

At the time of this study pre-registration, we, the authors, had 0 prior knowledge of the geography of the study region with regards to the COVID positive rates distribution in regards to various demographics phenomena to be studied.
This study is related to 0 prior studies by the authors. 
After acquiring the secondary data, we observed the full dataset and were able to explore the data by altering the shapefile and correcting the hexagon grids connectivity. 

### Bias and threats to validity

Given the research design and primary data to be collected and/or secondary data to be used, discuss common threats to validity and the approach to mitigating those threats, with an emphasis on geographic threats to validity.

These include:
  - uneven primary data collection due to geographic inaccessibility or other constraints
  - multiple hypothesis testing
  - edge or boundary effects
  - the modifiable areal unit problem
  - nonstationarity
  - spatial dependence or autocorrelation
  - temporal dependence or autocorrelation
  - spatial scale dependency
  - spatial anisotropies
  - confusion of spatial and a-spatial causation
  - ecological fallacy
  - uncertainty e.g. from spatial disaggregation, anonymization, differential privacy

### Data transformations

Describe all data transformations planned to prepare data sources for analysis.
This section should explain with the fullest detail possible how to transform data from the **raw** state at the time of acquisition or observation, to the pre-processed **derived** state ready for the main analysis.
Including steps to check and mitigate sources of **bias** and **threats to validity**.
The method may anticipate **contingencies**, e.g. tests for normality and alternative decisions to make based on the results of the test.
More specifically, all the **geographic** and **variable** transformations required to prepare input data as described in the data and variables section above to match the study's spatio-temporal characteristics as described in the study metadata and study design sections.
Visual workflow diagrams may help communicate the methodology in this section.

Examples of **geographic** transformations include coordinate system transformations, aggregation, disaggregation, spatial interpolation, distance calculations, zonal statistics, etc.

Examples of **variable** transformations include standardization, normalization, constructed variables, imputation, classification, etc.

Be sure to include any steps planned to **exclude** observations with *missing* or *outlier* data, to **group** observations by *attribute* or *geographic* criteria, or to **impute** missing data or apply spatial or temporal **interpolation**.

### Analysis

Describe the methods of analysis that will directly test the hypotheses or provide results to answer the research questions.
This section should explicitly define any spatial / statistical *models* and their *parameters*, including *grouping* criteria, *weighting* criteria, and *significance thresholds*.
Also explain any follow-up analyses or validations.

## Results

Describe how results are to be presented.

## Discussion

Describe how the results are to be interpreted *vis a vis* each hypothesis or research question.

## Integrity Statement

We completed this preregistration to the best of our knowledge and that no other preregistration exists pertaining to the same hypotheses and research.
